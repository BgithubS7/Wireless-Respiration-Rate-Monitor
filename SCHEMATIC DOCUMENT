SENSOR SCHEMATIC DOCUMENT
Add the description for the board design and choice of protocol used for the sensor and why you decided to choose that for the design
The logical power supply voltage I am using is about 1.8V. This is based on the data sheet specification and since I consider power to be of a great deal 
I decided to use LED supply voltage of about 5V.In the schematic design, two I2C external lines are used for pull up. 
DC -DC converters are used as well. Due to the amount of current I wish to draw from the circuitk, I have added two load switches to help me achieve that. For a detail observation of the design,
