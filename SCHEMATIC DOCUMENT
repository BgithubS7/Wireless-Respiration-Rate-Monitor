VOLTAGE DOMAIN:
Voltage Domains & Justification
Logic Power Supply (1.8V):
The core logic level for all digital components is maintained at 1.8V, as specified in the datasheets of the key ICs (e.g., microcontroller, IMU sensor).

This low-voltage domain was chosen for power efficiency, reduced switching noise, and to meet the I/O level requirements of connected digital peripherals.

LED Power Supply (5V):
To ensure proper brightness and current handling, the LEDs in the system are driven by a dedicated 5V supply rail.

This isolates high-current LED loads from sensitive logic circuits.

It also avoids undervoltage conditions that might result from driving LEDs at sub-optimal voltages.

ðŸ”Œ IÂ²C Pull-up Strategy
The design includes two IÂ²C external lines, each equipped with pull-up resistors tied to the 1.8V logic rail.

This ensures proper line idle-state detection, signal integrity, and compatibility with 1.8V logic-level IÂ²C devices.

Careful selection of pull-up resistor values balances rise time and bus capacitance to maintain signal timing and avoid IÂ²C violations.

DC-DC Converters for Efficient Regulation
High-efficiency DC-DC converters are used to generate and regulate both 1.8V and 5V power rails from a primary input source (e.g., 3.7V Li-ion or 12V adapter).

These converters were selected to optimize thermal performance, load regulation, and power conversion efficiency, especially under dynamic loads.

ðŸ”€ Load Switch Integration
The design includes two power load switches on key branches of the 5V and/or 1.8V power rails.

This allows for selective power distribution, enabling or disabling sections of the circuit (e.g., sensors, LEDs, comm modules) under firmware control.

Load switches were sized to handle the expected current draw and ensure low R<sub>DS(ON)</sub> for minimal voltage drop.

Inrush current control and soft-start functionality are optionally supported to prevent brownouts.
Ripple performance and transient response were evaluated to prevent noise coupling into sensitive analog and digital blocks.
