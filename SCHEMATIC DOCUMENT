VOLTAGE DOMAIN:
Voltage Domains & Justification
Logic Power Supply (1.8V):
The core logic level for all digital components is maintained at 1.8V, as specified in the datasheets of the key ICs (e.g., microcontroller, IMU sensor).

This low-voltage domain was chosen for power efficiency, reduced switching noise, and to meet the I/O level requirements of connected digital peripherals.

LED Power Supply (5V):
To ensure proper brightness and current handling, the LEDs in the system are driven by a dedicated 5V supply rail.

This isolates high-current LED loads from sensitive logic circuits.

It also avoids undervoltage conditions that might result from driving LEDs at sub-optimal voltages.

ðŸ”Œ IÂ²C Pull-up Strategy
The design includes two IÂ²C external lines, each equipped with pull-up resistors tied to the 1.8V logic rail.

This ensures proper line idle-state detection, signal integrity, and compatibility with 1.8V logic-level IÂ²C devices.

Careful selection of pull-up resistor values balances rise time and bus capacitance to maintain signal timing and avoid IÂ²C violations.
