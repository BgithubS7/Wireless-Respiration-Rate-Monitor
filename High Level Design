## High-Level Design Concept

![High-Level Block Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7657137-93c0-469c-b91c-77b22a66a880)

ðŸ”— **Reference**: [View the full block diagram here](https://github.com/BgithubS7/Wireless-Respiration-Rate-Monitor/blob/main/README.md)

The design emphasizes **modular documentation** for each functional block of the wearable system:
1. **Sensing**
2. **Microcontroller Unit (MCU)**
3. **Connectivity**
4. **Power**

Each subsystem has its own schematic file but interfaces through a **central power circuit**, ensuring reliable operation and seamless integration.

### ðŸ“˜ Block-by-Block Explanation

#### 1. Wearable Sensing Circuit (SCH DOC)
- **Purpose**: Captures the respiration signal (e.g., stretch sensor, thermistor, or piezo element).
- **Contents**: Analog frontend including amplifier and filter stages, signal conditioning circuits.
- **Feeds Into**: The MCU block, which digitizes or processes the signal.

#### 2. Wearable MCU Schematic (DOC)
- **Purpose**: Acts as the processing and control core of the system.
- **Contents**: Microcontroller (e.g., ESP32, nRF52), ADC for signal digitization, firmware control logic.
- **Links To**:
  - Sensing Circuit (input)
  - Connectivity Module (output)
  - Power Circuit (supply)

#### 3. Wearable Connectivity Module (BLE/Wi-Fi) (SCH DOC)
- **Purpose**: Enables wireless transmission of respiration data to external devices (e.g., smartphone or cloud).
- **Contents**: BLE/Wi-Fi chip or module, RF matching network, antenna interface.
- **Feeds Into**: External application or cloud service.
- **Powered By**: Central power circuit.

#### 4. Wearable Power Circuit (SCH DOC)
- **Purpose**: Centralized power supply for all modules.
- **Contents**: Battery interface (LiPo, coin cell), voltage regulators (LDOs or buck converters), optional charging circuit.
- **Feeds Power To**: Sensing, MCU, and Connectivity blocks.
- **Design Consideration**: Sized and regulated based on total system power requirements.
