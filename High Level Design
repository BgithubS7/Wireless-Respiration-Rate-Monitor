# Reference: View the block diagram here: https://github.com/BgithubS7/Wireless-Respiration-Rate-Monitor/blob/main/README.md

The design emphasizes modular documentation for each functional block of the wearable system:
 1. Sensing 
2. Microcontroller unit (MCU) 
3. Connectivity 
4. Power 

Each subsystem has its own schematic file, but they all interface through the central power circuit, ensuring reliable operation and integration. 
Block-by-Block Explanation 
1. Wearable Sensing Circuit SCH DOC 
Purpose: Captures the respiration signal (likely from a stretch sensor, thermistor, or piezo).
Contents: Analog frontend (e.g., amplifier, filter) Signal conditioning circuits
Feeds Into: The MCU block â€” it digitizes or processes the signal. 

2. Wearable Sensing MCU Schematic DOC 
Purpose: Acts as the brain of the system. 
Contents: Microcontroller (e.g., ESP32, nRF52) ADC for sensor signal digitization, Firmware interface to control sensing and communication 
Links To: Sensing Circuit (input) Connectivity Module (output) Power Circuit (for supply) 

3. Wearable Connectivity (BLE or Wi-Fi) SCH DOC 
Purpose: Enables wireless data transmission of respiration data to external devices (e.g., phone, cloud).
Contents: BLE or Wi-Fi chip/module Matching network (for RF) Antenna interface 
Feeds Into: External app or database Powered by: Central power schematic 


4. Wearable Power Circuit Schematic Doc
Purpose: Central power hub of the system.
Contents: Battery interface (LiPo, coin cell, etc.) Voltage regulation (LDOs, buck converters), Charging circuits (if rechargeable)
Feeds Power To: All other modules 
Dependency: Must be sized and regulated based on requirements of sensing, MCU, and connectivity blocks
